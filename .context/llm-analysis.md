# LLM Analysis Pipeline

The analysis pipeline uses LangChain + OpenAI to evaluate story relevance through three stages. All stages use `withStructuredOutput` + Zod schemas for reliable parsing. Schema `.describe()` annotations carry format guidance (including Markdown instructions for longer text fields), so prompts use declarative constraints rather than procedural step-by-step instructions.

## Model Configuration

Configuration is centralized in `server/src/config.ts`. Three model tiers are available:

| Tier | Default Model | Reasoning Effort | Used By |
|------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Small | `gpt-5-nano` | `medium` | Reclassification (issue + emotion only) |
| Medium | `gpt-5-mini` | `medium` | Pre-assessment (includes issue assignment) |
| Large | `gpt-5.2` | `medium` | Full assessment, selection, podcast script |

Environment variables:
- `OPENAI_MODEL_SMALL` — default `gpt-5-nano`
- `OPENAI_MODEL_MEDIUM` — default `gpt-5-mini`
- `OPENAI_MODEL_LARGE` — default `gpt-5.2`
- `LLM_DELAY_MS` — rate limit delay between calls (default 1000ms)

## Prompts Directory

Prompt templates live in `server/src/prompts/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `shared.ts` | `Guidelines` interface, `buildGuidelinesXml()`, `escapeXml()`, `containsChineseCharacters()` |
| `preassess.ts` | `buildPreassessPrompt()` — batch screening + issue classification |
| `reclassify.ts` | `buildReclassifyPrompt()` — issue + emotion reclassification (no rating) |
| `assess.ts` | `buildAssessPrompt()` — full analysis |
| `select.ts` | `buildSelectPrompt()` — editorial curation |
| `podcast.ts` | `buildPodcastPrompt()` — podcast script generation |
| `index.ts` | Barrel re-exports all builders and types |

## Schema-Driven Format Guidance

The Zod schemas in `server/src/schemas/llm.ts` use `.describe()` to tell the LLM how to format each field. Key format decisions:

- **Markdown output**: `factors`, `limitingFactors`, `relevanceCalculation`, and `relevanceSummary` use Markdown with bold labels (e.g., `**Factor name:** explanation`)
- **Plain text**: `summary`, `quote`, `relevanceTitle`, `marketingBlurb` remain plain text
- **Emotion tags**: The five emotion definitions are embedded in the schema description

## Shared Batch Classification

Both pre-assessment and reclassification use `runBatchClassification()` in `analysis.ts` — a generic helper that handles DB fetching, issue slug resolution, batching, semaphore-gated concurrent LLM calls, progress reporting, and DB transaction writes. Callers provide the LLM instance, schema, prompt builder, and an update function that determines which fields to write per story. The `fallbackToFeedIssue` option controls whether stories omitted from the LLM response get their `issueId` overwritten to the feed default (enabled for pre-assessment, disabled for reclassification to preserve existing assignments).

## Analysis Stages

### 0. Reclassification (Batch, Non-destructive)

Re-runs issue classification and emotion tagging without changing ratings or status. Uses the small model. Triggered manually via the admin bulk "Reclassify" action. Does not overwrite any fields for stories the LLM omits from its response.

**Zod schema**: `reclassifyResultSchema` — array of `{ articleId, issueSlug, emotionTag }`

**Use case**: Fix misclassified issues or update emotion tags after issue definitions change, without re-running the full pipeline.

### 1. Pre-assessment (Batch)

Screens multiple stories per LLM call (~10 per batch, fewer for Chinese text). In a single call, the LLM classifies each story into the most relevant issue, assigns a conservative rating (1-10), and assigns an emotion tag. Uses the medium model with medium reasoning effort. All stories are batched together regardless of issue — pre-assessment uses only the generic rating scale (1-10 impact criteria), not issue-specific guidelines. Falls back to `story.feed.issueId` if the LLM returns an invalid issue slug.

**Zod schema**: `preAssessResultSchema` — array of `{ articleId, issueSlug, rating, emotionTag }`

**Threshold**: Only stories rated >= 3 proceed to full assessment.

**Precedence**: Downstream code (assessStory, podcast, RSS feeds) uses `story.issue ?? story.feed.issue`.

### 2. Full Assessment (Individual)

Detailed analysis of a single story. Produces structured fields covering relevance factors, limiting factors, ratings, summary, title, and marketing blurb. Uses the large model with medium reasoning effort.

**Zod schema**: `assessResultSchema` — the largest schema, with detailed `.describe()` annotations guiding Markdown format for analytical fields.

### 3. Selection (Batch)

Takes all recently analyzed stories, formats them as XML with their AI metadata, and asks the LLM to select the top 50% by comparing articles directly. Uses the large model (important final curation step) with medium reasoning effort.

**Zod schema**: `selectResultSchema` — `{ selectedIds: string[] }`

## Issue-Specific Guidelines

Each Issue (topic category) has three prompt sections stored in the database:
- `promptFactors` — relevance factors specific to this topic
- `promptAntifactors` — topic-specific limiting factors
- `promptRatings` — rating criteria (1-10 scale definitions)

These are injected into prompt templates as `<FACTORS>`, `<TOPIC-SPECIFIC LIMITING FACTORS>`, and `<CRITERIA>` XML sections. They are used only in full assessment (stage 2), not in pre-assessment.

## Modifying Prompts or Output Format

To change prompts: edit the relevant file in `server/src/prompts/`. To change output format: update both the prompt AND the Zod schema in `server/src/schemas/llm.ts`. The schema `.describe()` annotations directly affect LLM output format.

See `.context/prompting.md` for GPT-5 prompt design principles that must be followed when modifying prompts.
