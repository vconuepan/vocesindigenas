# Content Extraction

The crawler fetches RSS feeds and extracts article content using a 3-tier fallback chain. Each tier is tried in order; the first one that produces enough text wins.

## Extraction Chain

```
1. CSS Selector (feed-specific)
   ↓ fails or too short
2. Mozilla Readability (ML-based)
   ↓ fails
3. Configured API (Diffbot or PipFeed, no fallback)
```

### Tier 1: CSS Selector

If the feed has an `htmlSelector` configured (e.g., `article.post-content`), the extractor queries that selector on the fetched HTML. This is the most reliable method for feeds with consistent layouts.

**When to use**: Set `htmlSelector` on a feed when Readability fails or extracts too much noise (nav, sidebars, etc.).

**Minimum length**: Content must be at least `config.crawl.minContentLength` characters (default 50) to be accepted. If shorter, falls through to Readability. This threshold applies to all three extraction tiers.

### Tier 2: Mozilla Readability

Uses `@mozilla/readability` with `jsdom` to extract the main article content. Works well for standard news articles. This is the primary extraction method for most feeds.

### Tier 3: External API

Only the configured `config.crawl.extractionApi` (default `diffbot`) is called — there is no fallback to the other API. Requires `DIFFBOT_TOKEN` or `PIPFEED_API_KEY` depending on which API is configured. Skipped if the required key isn't set.

All API calls go through a shared `ApiThrottle` that serializes requests and handles 429 rate limiting. On 429: waits a 30-second backoff, then doubles the inter-call delay (up to 30 seconds max). Successful calls gradually halve the delay back toward the base. This means the system slows down instead of stopping — it respects the provider's signal without abandoning the crawl.

### Local Extraction Skip

When consecutive articles in a feed all fail local extraction (tiers 1+2), the crawler skips local extraction for remaining articles (controlled by `config.crawl.localFailThreshold`, default 3). This avoids wasting time on HTTP 403s from sites that block scrapers. The counter increments both when extraction succeeds via API (local failed but API worked) and when extraction fails entirely (local + API both failed). The counter resets when any article succeeds via a local method. With the default concurrency of 3, the first batch always attempts local extraction; the threshold takes effect for subsequent articles.

### Total Failure Bail-Out

When consecutive articles all fail extraction entirely (local + API both return nothing), the crawler stops attempting remaining articles (controlled by `config.crawl.totalFailThreshold`, default 3). This prevents burning API quota on feeds where the source blocks all extraction methods. The counter resets when any article succeeds.

### Mid-Flight Cancellation

The crawler passes a `shouldAbort` callback (tied to the `skipAll` flag) through `extractContent()` → `extractByApi()` → `ApiThrottle.run()`. This allows in-flight extractions to bail out before making expensive API calls — even if they started before `skipAll` was set. The abort is checked at three points: before the API tier in `extractContent()`, before entering the throttle in `extractByApi()`, and after dequeuing/backoff-waiting inside `ApiThrottle.run()`. This prevents wasting 30+ seconds on API backoff waits for articles in a feed that has already been identified as failing.

## Resource Limits

HTTP responses from page fetches, RSS feeds, and external API calls (Diffbot, PipFeed) are capped at 5 MB (`maxContentLength`) to prevent OOM on pathological responses. JSDOM DOM objects are explicitly released via `dom.window.close()` in a `finally` block after Readability extraction, as JSDOM windows hold timers, event listeners, and expanded DOM trees that are not reliably garbage collected without explicit cleanup. Outbound webhook and email service (Plunk) responses are capped at 1 MB. The Bluesky og:image fetch uses `AbortSignal.timeout(10_000)` to prevent hanging. Favicon fetches use streaming reads with per-chunk size checks to avoid allocating large buffers for unexpected responses.

## Crawl Flow

```
RSS Feed → Parse items (max config.crawl.rssItemLimit, default 20)
         → Deduplicate against existing story URLs
         → For each new item (parallel, up to config.concurrency.crawlArticles):
            → Fetch page HTML (with retry, timeout config.crawl.httpTimeoutMs)
            → Extract content (3-tier chain)
            → Create story with status 'fetched'
         → Update feed's lastCrawledAt
```

Feeds are crawled in parallel (up to `config.concurrency.crawlFeeds`, default 5). Article extraction within each feed also runs in parallel (up to `config.concurrency.crawlArticles`, default 3). All HTTP requests (RSS parsing, page fetching, PipFeed API) use `withRetry()` from `server/src/lib/retry.ts` (3 attempts with exponential backoff).

### Deduplication

URLs are normalized (HTTPS, no trailing slash, no tracking params, sorted query) before any dedup logic. The crawler first removes duplicates within the RSS batch itself, then batch-checks remaining URLs against existing stories using `getExistingUrls()`. As a safety net, P2002 unique constraint errors during `createStory` (e.g., from concurrent crawls) are treated as skips rather than errors.

### Manual Crawling

- `POST /api/admin/stories/crawl-url` — crawl a single URL into a specific feed
- `POST /api/admin/feeds/:id/crawl` — trigger full RSS crawl for one feed
- `POST /api/admin/feeds/crawl-all` — crawl all feeds that are due

## Adding a New Feed

1. Create the feed via `POST /api/admin/feeds` with the RSS URL and issue ID
2. Test the crawl: `POST /api/admin/feeds/:id/crawl`
3. Check extracted content quality in the stories
4. If content is noisy or incomplete, set `htmlSelector` on the feed via `PUT /api/admin/feeds/:id`
